        <p> First, in order to use the API you must have a key. It is free and pretty easy to obtain an API key. Just visit the
            following site and enter your first name last name, email address, and website you will use the key with.
            It is emailed to you straight away. Plus it will allow you access to many more US government API's if you are
            interested.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to get a key for my intended website, then created and edit the webpage examples on a local host.
            If you don't have a website, there are a lot of free website builders if you just type in 'free website' in a
            search many will come up. This will allow you to get started with the API without having to pay anything.
